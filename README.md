# InternetRadioScrapper

A scrapper for website [internet-radio.com](https://internet-radio.com).

I made this because I was annoyed by the lack of a search engine on this page, I will probably also make a simple GUI to browse these results.


## How to use
Just create an instance of **com.github.wprusik.radioscrapper.InternetRadioScrapper** and invoke one of its methods.

## Legal issues
This is just a hobby project, so I didn't go into the legal issues. I don't take responsibility for possible violation of someone's rights by using this application, <ins>you use it at your own risk</ins>.
